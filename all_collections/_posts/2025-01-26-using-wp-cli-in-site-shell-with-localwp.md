## Tips for Efficient Use

Here are some additional tips and best practices for working with WP-CLI in LocalWP:

### Aliases for Faster Access

You can create an alias for WP-CLI commands to save time. For example, add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias wp="wp --allow-root"
```

Reload the shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Managing Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in LocalWP to simplify your workflow. For instance, define constants for debugging:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

You can add these to your `wp-config.php` file for development purposes.

### Error: "Command not found"

Ensure you have opened the Site Shell provided by LocalWP. WP-CLI is only available in the containerized environment.

### Error: "Database connection failed"

If you encounter database issues, ensure that your LocalWP site is running and that the database credentials in `wp-config.php` match the LocalWP configuration.
