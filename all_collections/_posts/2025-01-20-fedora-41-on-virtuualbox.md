## Why Use VirtualBox?

**VirtualBox** is an open-source virtualization tool that allows you to create and run virtual machines on your computer. With VirtualBox, you can easily test different operating systems without altering your main system configuration. It's ideal for developers and beginners who want to familiarize themselves with Linux or other operating systems in an isolated environment.
