### Step 1: Download the RPM Package

The Local team offers a prebuilt `.rpm` package for Linux users. You can download it directly from the official website or using the link below:

[Download Local RPM Package](https://cdn.localwp.com/releases-stable/9.1.1+6738/local-9.1.1-linux.rpm)

### Step 2: Install the RPM Package

Once the download is complete, open your terminal, navigate to the folder where the file is located, and install it using `dnf`:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./local-9.1.1-linux.rpm
```

## Step 3: Launch Local by Flywheel
After the installation is complete, you can start Local by Flywheel either from your application menu or by running:

```bash
local
```

### Step 4: Common Troubleshooting
Missing Dependencies
If Local doesnâ€™t start, you may need to install a few missing dependencies. 

```bash
sudo dnf update
```

Permissions
Make sure youâ€™re running Local as a standard user, not as root. Running it as root can cause issues with file permissions.

## Step 5: Fixing Common Errors
If you encounter the following error while starting a site:

```vbnet
Uh-oh! Unable to start site.
Error: Command failed: ... Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket ...
```

This happens because of a missing dependency. To resolve this issue, install the libxcrypt-compat package:

```bash
sudo dnf install libxcrypt-compat
```

After installing the dependency, try starting your site again.

### Step 5: Start Developing!
Once Local is up and running, you can create new WordPress sites, import existing ones, or configure your environment to your liking. Local offers features like faster site creation, SSL support, and advanced tools for developers.

## Conclusion
Installing Local by Flywheel on Fedora is now easier than ever, thanks to the native .rpm package. With just a few simple steps, you can enjoy one of the best local WordPress development tools available.
