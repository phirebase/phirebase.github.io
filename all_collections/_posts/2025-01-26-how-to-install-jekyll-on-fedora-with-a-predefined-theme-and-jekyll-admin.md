## Installing a Jekyll Project with a Theme

You can initialize a Jekyll project using a GitHub repository template that includes your desired theme.

### Using a Repository Template

One option is to directly clone a repository with a pre-configured theme. For example, to use the `jekyll-theme-serial-programmer`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-serial-programmer.git devblog
```

This command:

- Clones the project with the theme into a folder named `devblog`.

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd devblog
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

Finally, start the local server:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

   gem "jekyll-admin"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the new dependency:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Run the Server with Jekyll Admin**  
   Start the Jekyll server, and Jekyll Admin will be accessible:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. **Access the Admin Interface**
